## Project Work Time

Now that we have learned a little more about regular expressions and how to use
and apply them in Java, it's time to apply this new knowledge to our projects!

Modify the `Airport` class to have an airport code. Consider the following
instructions:

- Add a three-character airport code to the `Airport` class.
  - The airport code must consist of three capital letters, like such:
    - DEN (Denver International Airport).
    - PHL (Philadelphia International Airport).
    - PAW (Pawnee Airport).
- Modify the `AirportReservationDriver` class.
  - Update the method where the user can add an airport.
  - When the user adds an airport, validate that the airport code meets the
    above format.
- Tips:
  - Use Regex 101 when needed.
  - Refer to the Java Documentation as needed. Below are some resources.
